# YEAR OF BIRTH CALCULATOR:
Version 01
This is a simple Java program to calculate the birth year of a person based on their age and provide unit tests for the validation methods. When the program runs then it will ask the user their name and age through scanner, after that the user will see a greeting message to see their birth year.



## Getting Started
To create this program we use a main method alongside the multiple custom methods so that, the main method becomes more concise and focuses on the overall flow of the program, while the custom methods handle specific tasks. 
On the other hand, it includes 2 classes with this ReadMe file; one of them is dedicated for unit tests when the other includes the custom methods and main method.
